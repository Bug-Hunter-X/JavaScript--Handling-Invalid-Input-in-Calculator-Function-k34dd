# JavaScript Calculator with Improved Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: the lack of robust error handling.  The initial `calculate` function in `bug.js` does not gracefully handle invalid operator inputs and only throws an error when dividing by zero. 

The improved version in `bugSolution.js` addresses these issues using more comprehensive input validation and error handling, ensuring a more robust and user-friendly experience.
